## 🔍 Project Overview

Zomato receives lakhs of reviews every month. Reading them one by one is not possible. This project analyzes **20K+ customer reviews** and shows:

* What customers like
* What makes them angry
* Which problem hurts the business the most

The dashboard helps **product, delivery, and support teams** take quick action.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Customer feedback is unstructured (text reviews). Without analysis:

* Issues remain hidden
* Teams work on the wrong priorities
* Customer experience suffers

This dashboard converts reviews into:

* Clear trends
* Top complaint areas
* Monthly performance tracking

---

## 📊 Key Insights (Simple)

* ⭐ **Average Rating:** 3.7 / 5
* 😊 **Positive Reviews:** 69%
* 😡 **Biggest Problem:** Delivery issues (**13.9K complaints**)
* 📅 **Worst Month:** October (**3.3K negative reviews**)
* 📈 **Improvement Seen:** November (after fixes)

👉 Delivery problems are **2x bigger** than food quality issues.

---

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights

* Month-wise sentiment trend
* Issue-wise complaint comparison
* Interactive slicers (searchable month filter)
* Auto-updating KPIs

**Try this:**

* Select **October** → Negative reviews jump instantly
* Delivery bar becomes highest → Clear action needed

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
